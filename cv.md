## Junior Frontend Developer

I've been writing in __JavaScript__ for one year. Iâ€™m entirely self-taught by means of online courses and lectures, specialized literature and official documentation.
I learn Javascript using the following sources:
* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/);
* [JavaScript Tutorial](https://learn.javascript.ru/);
* [JS Courses](https://htmlacademy.ru/courses/javascript)
* [Hexlet JS Courses](https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/javascript_101)

I regularly watch webinars such as [GeekBrains](https://geekbrains.ru/events), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/development/web-development/) and lessons on YouTube.

I improve my practical skills by solving Codewars catas. My Codewars profile: [Samad86](https://www.codewars.com/users/Samad86)

Skill set: JS (Framework: [React](https://ru.reactjs.org/); IDE: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), Git ([GitHub](https://github.com/))
